# Module 12 Challenge: An Analysis of UK Food Establishments With NoSQL
The purpose of this challenge is to perform an in-depth analysis of various food and beverage establishments across the United Kingdom, according to evaluations by the UK Food Standards Agency. This analysis is completed by use of MongoDB, a NoSQL database management program. 

## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
In the first part of this challenge, I set up the database environment for analysis. In the first step, I imported the data from the establishment.json file (Starter_Code/Resources) into a new database called 'uk_food' and a new collection 'establishments'. Next, I imported the required libraries (PyMongo and Pretty Print), created an instance of Mongo Client, and confirmed the creation of my collection and database. The code for Part 1 is found in Starter_Code/NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb.

## Part 2: Update the Database
